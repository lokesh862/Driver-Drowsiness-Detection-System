# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

Developed a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and Python.

Applied facial landmark detection to identify and track the user's eyes using the dlib library.

Calculated the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine whether the user's eyes are closed or open.

Implemented an alarm system to alert the user when drowsiness is detected.

Optimized the algorithm for real-time performance, achieving a high detection accuracy.
